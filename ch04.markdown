Dart provides several tools to help you write and deploy your web and
command-line apps. These tools include:

[pub: The Dart package and asset manager](/tools/pub/)

:   Download and install packages of libraries,
    prepare your app for deployment, and more.

[Dart Editor](/tools/editor/)

:   Edit, run, and debug web and command-line apps.

[Dartium: Chromium with the Dart VM](/tools/dartium/)

:   Run Dart web apps. This is a special build of Chromium (the project
    behind Google Chrome).

[dart2js: The Dart-to-JavaScript compiler](/tools/dart2js/)

:   Convert your web app to JavaScript, so it can run in non-Dartium
    browsers.

[dart: The standalone VM](/tools/dart-vm/)

:   Run your command-line apps—server-side scripts, programs, servers,
    and any other apps that don’t run in a browser.

[dartanalyzer: The static analyzer](/tools/analyzer/)

:   Analyze your Dart source from the command line.

All of these tools are
available in the Dart Editor download, but you can also download Dartium
or the SDK separately.

For information about these and other tools,
see [Dart Tools](/tools/).
